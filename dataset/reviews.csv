David,"I can’t tell this was a refurb. The packaging was new, looked like it had never been touched. Very pleased."
Makenna Meyers,Good product and very nice size
David,Everything looks and feels new for a resale item
Florencia,Great product. Syncs well with my iPhone. Battery life is marginal.
Amazon Customer,"Bought this for myself months ago, watch came in the original apple packaging with a usb-c charger, amazing quality for the money. decided to purchase again for my girlfriend a couple months later. this time the watch didn’t come in the original apple watch packaging and had a traditional usb charger, still came with the authentic watch band and watch itself, would still say it was very much worth the money and a great buy."
Anthony Taylor,I love it .
Austin Richardson,"Ordered this refurbished watch and the watch is great! The main problem I had with it was that it came with an aftermarket charger. This charger WOULD NOT charge the watch. It would start charging, then stop after a few seconds, then start again, and would keep doing this until I pulled it off the charger. I ordered an actual apple charger for the watch and the watch was charged in a matter of an hour or so.  I highly suggest ordering an apple charger at the same time you order the refurbished watch."
Denisnunez,I can’t even charge my watch right off the bat. Thoroughly disappointed that they weren’t able to have quality control over this. Now I have to drive to town to get the correct charging block.
Amanda Boyd,Gift to my niece who is an RN
Sheila Larson,Works great
Anita O Morris,
DUSTIN,i love apple products and stand by them but this goes within 5 hours of wearing after s ling night charged.
David,It’s a great watch. Although trying to hook the cellular up through AT&T has been a huge hassle.
Makenna Meyers,looks great.
Jas Rose,"didn't realized it was renewed.  Charging cord didn't come with a plug,  Had to spend $20 for device"
Makenna Meyers,It was just what I needed.
Lorraine Spain,Came in perfect condition in great time
Toribio Polanco,"Value for money, seller was courteous."
Richard A. Callis,This watch is wonderful! It has done everything I need and the battery life is great.
Beckie Townsend,Battery only last a day compared to my Garmin which can last almost 2 weeks without charge. The watch can come off if something hits your watch band from below causing permanent scratches to your watch.
Serena Perez,"My watch arrived quickly and the set up was seamless. So far, I’m impressed. Of course the packaging wasn’t as nice as from the actual Apple store, but everything I needed was included and in good shape. For the price I paid, I’m super happy so far! I’ll update this if anything goes awry."
T. Fasasi,Was supposed to include a sim removal tool and it wasn’t included
Margie,
Brian,disliked band.
David,"There was no SIM card tool and did not include the fast charging cord.  The  Watch did perform well after several hours of charging, and I am pleased with the watch over all.  It is a huge upgrade from my series three"
Makenna Meyers,Came in a timely manner and is exactly what they said it was. We would buy from the seller again.
britt.b.,watch does not turn on return is very difficult
Amazon Customer,"So we got the watch and everything works fine, except the cellular. After an hour on the phone with Verizon, we were told because it’s refurbished, if the previous owner had it set up with a different carrier’s E-sim card, it won’t work with Verizon, despite a factory reset. I’ve messaged the seller. I will update my review if/when I hear back…but beware, if you’re buying for the cellular, it may not work."
VILMAR JUNIOR DA SILVA,"Thought I ordered a new watch, not a refurbished watch.  Sending it back, as it won’t hold a charge."
Pete the shopper,Do not use this seller. The battery lasted 2 hours so I sent it back for a refund. They kept sending a message saying the watch was linked to my iPhone. The watch was cleared and returned properly. Buyers beware!!!!
ERIC P FELTON,Bought this and charged it all day. It died within a couple hours. Returned to seller with no issues and was refunded.
Amazon Customer,I purchased a series 7 Apple Watch from this company and it was a headache from the moment I took it out of the box and the Watch was below 7% battery life. I charged it and while doing so attempted to sync it to my phone which took 2 1/2 hours because the Watch would not update. After all that the watch would not accept a charge 12 hours on the charger. Don’t buy renewed products from Amazon
John,"Couldn't even use bc it was connected to someone else's account!  Awful, very disappointing!"
Andrew C Barker,"The Watch looks good and works well, but the battery dies within eight hours.  I guess this is one of those instances where if it’s too good to be true it’s too good to be true."
Norman C. Straker,"Too hard to figure it out, especially for seniors who are looking for all these indicators."
Machele Lugo,I got the “green snake of death” or “red snake” when unplugged where it has a defective battery and can’t be charged. They essentially sold me a defective Apple Watch right out the box
David,Doesn’t turn on and the wrong charge cube was included.
Makenna Meyers,I got this watch today Having a hard time pairing this Apple Watch to my phone I’m sending it back
Stephanie Paulette,This is not a brand new watch
travis schwarz,The watch only comes with half a charger. You don’t get the brick that plugs into the outlet. Plus the charger is the new lightning variety so it doesn’t fit their traditional USB Plug-in from older versions of the watch. Very disappointing
Dustin Spray,So far I love or. No issues with delivery or packaging.
S. J. Twigg,It seem to be working fine didn’t get the right charger for it glade my girlfriend got a charger for an Apple Watch
Ella M. Ryder,Bufno
thevin,Received the watch in the mail and it wouldn’t power on.
