The main problem I had with it was that it came with an aftermarket charger. This charger WOULD NOT charge the watch. It would start charging, then stop after a few seconds, then start again, and would keep doing this until I pulled it off the charger. I ordered an actual apple charger for the watch and the watch was charged in a matter of an hour or so.  I highly suggest ordering an apple charger at the same time you order the refurbished watch.\n","7":"\nI can’t even charge my watch right off the bat. Thoroughly disappointed that they weren’t able to have quality control over this. Now I have to drive to town to get the correct charging block.\n","8":"\nGift to my niece who is an RN\n","9":"\nWorks great\n","10":"","11":"\ni love apple products and stand by them but this goes within 5 hours of wearing after s ling night charged.\n","12":"\nIt’s a great watch. Although trying to hook the cellular up through AT&T has been a huge hassle.\n","13":"\nlooks great.\n","14":"\ndidn't realized it was renewed.  Charging cord didn't come with a plug,  Had to spend $20 for device\n","15":"\nIt was just what I needed.\n","16":"\nCame in perfect condition in great time\n","17":"\nValue for money, seller was courteous.\n","18":"\nThis watch is wonderful! It has done everything I need and the battery life is great.\n","19":"\nBattery only last a day compared to my Garmin which can last almost 2 weeks without charge. The watch can come off if something hits your watch band from below causing permanent scratches to your watch.\n","20":"\nMy watch arrived quickly and the set up was seamless. So far, I’m impressed. Of course the packaging wasn’t as nice as from the actual Apple store, but everything I needed was included and in good shape. For the price I paid, I’m super happy so far! I’ll update this if anything goes awry.\n","21":"\nWas supposed to include a sim removal tool and it wasn’t included\n","22":"","23":"\ndisliked band.\n","24":"\nThere was no SIM card tool and did not include the fast charging cord.  The  Watch did perform well after several hours of charging, and I am pleased with the watch over all.  It is a huge upgrade from my series three\n","25":"\nCame in a timely manner and is exactly what they said it was. We would buy from the seller again.\n","26":"\nwatch does not turn on return is very difficult\n","27":"\nSo we got the watch and everything works fine, except the cellular. After an hour on the phone with Verizon, we were told because it’s refurbished, if the previous owner had it set up with a different carrier’s E-sim card, it won’t work with Verizon, despite a factory reset. I’ve messaged the seller. I will update my review if/when I hear back…but beware, if you’re buying for the cellular, it may not work.\n","28":"\nThought I ordered a new watch, not a refurbished watch.  Sending it back, as it won’t hold a charge.\n","29":"\nDo not use this seller. The battery lasted 2 hours so I sent it back for a refund. They kept sending a message saying the watch was linked to my iPhone. The watch was cleared and returned properly. Buyers beware!!!!\n","30":"\nBought this and charged it all day. It died within a couple hours. Returned to seller with no issues and was refunded.\n","31":"\nI purchased a series 7 Apple Watch from this company and it was a headache from the moment I took it out of the box and the Watch was below 7% battery life. I charged it and while doing so attempted to sync it to my phone which took 2 1/2 hours because the Watch would not update. After all that the watch would not accept a charge 12 hours on the charger. Don’t buy renewed products from Amazon\n","32":"\nCouldn't even use bc it was connected to someone else's account!  Awful, very disappointing!\n","33":"\nThe Watch looks good and works well, but the battery dies within eight hours.  I guess this is one of those instances where if it’s too good to be true it’s too good to be true.\n","34":"\nToo hard to figure it out, especially for seniors who are looking for all these indicators.\n","35":"\nI got the “green snake of death” or “red snake” when unplugged where it has a defective battery and can’t be charged. They essentially sold me a defective Apple Watch right out the box\n","36":"\nDoesn’t turn on and the wrong charge cube was included.\n","37":"\nI got this watch today Having a hard time pairing this Apple Watch to my phone I’m sending it back\n","38":"\nThis is not a brand new watch\n","39":"\nThe watch only comes with half a charger. You don’t get the brick that plugs into the outlet. Plus the charger is the new lightning variety so it doesn’t fit their traditional USB Plug-in from older versions of the watch.

Very pleased.\n","1":"\nGood product and very nice size\n","2":"\nEverything looks and feels new for a resale item\n","3":"\nGreat product. Syncs well with my iPhone. Battery life is marginal.\n","4":"\nBought this for myself months ago, watch came in the original apple packaging with a usb-c charger, amazing quality for the money. decided to purchase again for my girlfriend a couple months later. this time the watch didn’t come in the original apple watch packaging and had a traditional usb charger, still came with the authentic watch band and watch itself, would still say it was very much worth the money and a great buy.\n","5":"\nI love it .\n","6":"\nOrdered this refurbished watch and the watch is great! The main problem I had with it was that it came with an aftermarket charger. This charger WOULD NOT charge the watch. It would start charging, then stop after a few seconds, then start again, and would keep doing this until I pulled it off the charger. I ordered an actual apple charger for the watch and the watch was charged in a matter of an hour or so.  I highly suggest ordering an apple charger at the same time you order the refurbished watch.\n","7":"\nI can’t even charge my watch right off the bat. Thoroughly disappointed that they weren’t able to have quality control over this. Now I have to drive to town to get the correct charging block.\n","8":"\nGift to my niece who is an RN\n","9":"\nWorks great\n","10":"","11":"\ni love apple products and stand by them but this goes within 5 hours of wearing after s ling night charged.\n","12":"\nIt’s a great watch. Although trying to hook the cellular up through AT&T has been a huge hassle.\n","13":"\nlooks great.\n","14":"\ndidn't realized it was renewed.  Charging cord didn't come with a plug,  Had to spend $20 for device\n","15":"\nIt was just what I needed.\n","16":"\nCame in perfect condition in great time\n","17":"\nValue for money, seller was courteous.\n","18":"\nThis watch is wonderful! It has done everything I need and the battery life is great.\n","19":"\nBattery only last a day compared to my Garmin which can last almost 2 weeks without charge. The watch can come off if something hits your watch band from below causing permanent scratches to your watch.\n","20":"\nMy watch arrived quickly and the set up was seamless. So far, I’m impressed. Of course the packaging wasn’t as nice as from the actual Apple store, but everything I needed was included and in good shape. For the price I paid, I’m super happy so far! I’ll update this if anything goes awry.\n","21":"\nWas supposed to include a sim removal tool and it wasn’t included\n","22":"","23":"\ndisliked band.\n","24":"\nThere was no SIM card tool and did not include the fast charging cord.  The  Watch did perform well after several hours of charging, and I am pleased with the watch over all.  It is a huge upgrade from my series three\n","25":"\nCame in a timely manner and is exactly what they said it was. We would buy from the seller again.\n","26":"\nwatch does not turn on return is very difficult\n","27":"\nSo we got the watch and everything works fine, except the cellular. After an hour on the phone with Verizon, we were told because it’s refurbished, if the previous owner had it set up with a different carrier’s E-sim card, it won’t work with Verizon, despite a factory reset. I’ve messaged the seller. I will update my review if/when I hear back…but beware, if you’re buying for the cellular, it may not work.\n","28":"\nThought I ordered a new watch, not a refurbished watch.  Sending it back, as it won’t hold a charge.\n","29":"\nDo not use this seller. The battery lasted 2 hours so I sent it back for a refund. They kept sending a message saying the watch was linked to my iPhone. The watch was cleared and returned properly. Buyers beware!!!!\n","30":"\nBought this and charged it all day. It died within a couple hours. Returned to seller with no issues and was refunded.\n","31":"\nI purchased a series 7 Apple Watch from this company and it was a headache from the moment I took it out of the box and the Watch was below 7% battery life. I charged it and while doing so attempted to sync it to my phone which took 2 1/2 hours because the Watch would not update. After all that the watch would not accept a charge 12 hours on the charger. Don’t buy renewed products from Amazon\n","32":"\nCouldn't even use bc it was connected to someone else's account!  Awful, very disappointing!\n","33":"\nThe Watch looks good and works well, but the battery dies within eight hours.  I guess this is one of those instances where if it’s too good to be true it’s too good to be true.\n","34":"\nToo hard to figure it out, especially for seniors who are looking for all these indicators.\n","35":"\nI got the “green snake of death” or “red snake” when unplugged where it has a defective battery and can’t be charged. They essentially sold me a defective Apple Watch right out the box\n","36":"\nDoesn’t turn on and the wrong charge cube was included.\n","37":"\nI got this watch today Having a hard time pairing this Apple Watch to my phone I’m sending it back\n","38":"\nThis is not a brand new watch\n","39":"\nThe watch only comes with half a charger. You don’t get the brick that plugs into the outlet. Plus the charger is the new lightning variety so it doesn’t fit their traditional USB Plug-in from older versions of the watch. Very disappointing\n","40":"\nSo far I love or. No issues with delivery or packaging.\n","41":"\nIt seem to be working fine didn’t get the right charger for it glade my girlfriend got a charger for an Apple Watch\n","42":"\nBufno\n","43":"\nReceived the watch in the mail and it wouldn’t power on.\n","_deepnote_index_column":"Reviews"}]},"text/plain":"                                                              0   \\\nReviewer Name                                              David   \nReviews        \\nI can’t tell this was a refurb.
